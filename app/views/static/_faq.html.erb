<h5>• What does OpenSNP offer me as a genotyping-customers?</h5>
<p>If you got genotyped by <a href="http://www.23andme.com">23andMe</a> or <a href="http://www.decodeme.com/">deCODEme</a> you can upload the raw genotype data which you can download from your DTC test provider. The data will then be openly available for the world to see and download. We also parse these SNPs and annotate them.</p><p>For annotation we include the manually curated <a href="http://www.snpedia.com">SNPedia</a> and find Open Access primary publications which appear in the journals of <a href="http://www.plos.org">The Public Library of Science</a> (PLoS), a Open Access publishing group. Additionally we screen <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, a crowd-sourced repository of scientific publications.</p><p>You can also publish some of your phenotypes so some day it might get possible to associate some SNPs with phenotypes (because of this we really would like to encourage you to do so, helping science generates this warm, fuzzy feeling inside of you).</p><p>And of course you can also share your knowledge about SNPs and phenotypes with other users and can socialize.</p>

<h5>• Who is behind openSNP?</h5>
The site is hosted and was coded by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gedankenstuecke">Bastian</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/108875984450420228123/posts">Fabian</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/helgerausch">Helge</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/PhilippBayer">Philipp</a>. Bastian, Fabian and Philipp did their undergraduate studies in Life Sciences and are currently doing their master-programmes. Bastian currently studies Ecology & Evolution, Fabian studies Biology and Philipp studies Computer Science. Helge is the only “real” web developer on the team and has helped us a lot in testing much of the things we did. We are not working full time on this project, this is more of a hobby. Please give us some time to answer your questions, fix bugs and stuff like this as we are doing this in our free time besides our studies and day jobs.

<h5>• Why all this?</h5>
<em>openSNP</em> is a non-profit, <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr">open-source</a> project that is about sharing genetical and phenotypic information. The idea to this project came to Bastian after he was genotyped by 23andMe in May and started playing around with his data. During his research he became frustrated, because it was not that easy to find mode data. He started working on openSNP to fix this. To be clear: This project is not about making money, selling data or to quote Google: “We don’t wanna be evil”. We are just interested in making science more open and accessible.

<h5>• How much does a membership in openSNP cost?</h5>
We take the "open" in openSNP serious, so everything is free of charge.

<h5>• Where can I download my raw data on the page of my DTC company?</h5>
<em>23andMe</em> customers can <a href="https://www.23andme.com/you/download/"> download the data here</a>. <em>deCODEme</em> customers can <a href="https://www.decodeme.com/download">find the data here</a>. If you were genotyped by <em>FamilytreeDNA</em> you can <a href="https://www.familytreedna.com/my-ftdna/download-files.aspx">find your files here</a>. 

<h5>• How long does it take until my genotyping data is available on the site after uploading?</h5>
This heavily depends on how many other users are in the queue, waiting for their data to be parsed. Right now openSNP runs on a small scale server so it may take 2-3 days until all your variations can be found on the site. But you can start using openSNP right away and others can download your raw-data right from the start. The parsing only affects the "other users sharing this SNP" and the "my genotype"-views.

<h5>• I was genotyped by another DTC company, why can't i upload my data?</h5>
We are always interested in adding more data. If your company is missing up to now it is, because we did not have an example-file to optimize our parser on it. But if you contact us at <%=link_to "parsing@opensnp.org","mailto:parsing@opensnp.org"%> and send us your file we can fix this, so that all customers of the DTC company of your choice can participate.

<h5>• How open is my data?</h5>
Completely open: Everyone can see everything you enter or upload (except your private messages and your password, of course). We warn every user twice about this: Once during the user-creation and once before the genotyping-file-upload. You can find more information about the risks of publishing the data by <%=link_to "reading the disclaimer", "/disclaimer"%>

<h5>• The phenotype I'm interested in is not yet in openSNP. What can I do?</h5>
You can easily add this phenotype as long as you are logged in. Just visit <%=link_to("the page for phenotype creation", {:controller => "phenotypes",:action => "new"})%> and enter a name and a description that enables other users to understand what you are interested in. 

<h5>• I've found a bug, what can I do?</h5>
Just send us an <a href="mailto:info@opensnp.org">email</a>.

	<h5>• What does OpenSNP offer me as a researcher working on human SNPs?</h5>
	<p>We can offer you data, hopefully someday even lots of data. <em>23andMe</em> alone genotyped already over 100.000 people and more and more of them are sharing their SNPs, as well as their phenotypes.</p><p>	Logged-In users can search our database for users with specific phenotypes and mass-download all corresponding SNP-datasets. This allows you to get datasets like <em>"All genotyping files of openSNP-users that have Alzheimer"</em> and the corresponding control group.</p><p>	If you'd like to be informed about new genotyping results in general, or just about all new data sets for a specific phenotype, you can use the RSS-feeds we offer.</p>

	<h5>• How can i start a mass download?</h5>
	This option is only available for logged-in users. Just visit the phenotype-page of your choice and click on the download-links for the variations you are interested in. Our server will grab all the data for you, make a handy zip-file out of it and send you the download link via email, as this can be a lot of data.
	
	<h5>• Is there an API for searching/downloading files?</h5>
	We are currently working on providing a simple API, but up to now there is none. If you want to automate the file-downloads for a given phenotype the RSS-feeds could help you. Inside the RSS-XML there are 2 flags you could use to automatically create correct genotype-groups: <em><%=raw("&lt;")%>variation<%=raw("&gt;")%></em> gives you the variation of this user at the phenotype you are looking at and <em><%=raw("&lt;")%>dlink<%=raw("&gt;")%></em> gives you the download link.

	<h5>• What do I have to consider while entering my variation for already existing phenotypes?</h5>
	<strong>1.</strong>You should read the description on the phenotype you are about to enter. Often the description gives further details on which kind of answers people are interested in. You can also take a look on the answers which are given so far by other users. This should also give you a feeling about what kind of information is wanted for this phenotype. <br/><strong>2.</strong> As soon as you start to enter your own variation we will try to auto-complete your writing to avoid duplicate entries into the openSNP-database. Having multiple entries for the same thing, like "blue-green" plus "green-blue" in case of eye-colour makes it harder for (citizen) scientists to use the data for their studies. <br/><strong>3.</strong> The thing you are about to enter doesn't get auto-completed? Great. You are about to enter a variation which has not been reported so far, have fun entering your data! 
	
	<h5>• What should I consider while creating a new phenotype?</h5>
	<strong>1.</strong> Use a reasonable name for your characteristic. Don't make it too long, but at the same time make sure that people get the general idea of what you want to know. <br/><strong>2.</strong> You should also make sure that the same phenotype is not already available in the openSNP-database. As soon as you start writing your characteristics name openSNP will try to auto-complete what you are writing. This should reduce duplicate phenotypes, so if you are about to enter "eye-colour" you will get a suggestions for the already available "eye-color" (Sorry, we can't solve the AE / BE issue here).<br/><strong>3.</strong> Write a description about the characteristic you are interested in. Give users some words why this is interesting. Maybe add what research has been done so far on this phenotype. Links to further web-resources and/or Wikipedia might also be a good idea. If you already have suggestions which different answers might apply to this phenotype: List them in the description. <br/><strong>4.</strong> Enter your own variation: The last field, "variation" is meant to carry your own variation for this phenotype. Don't enter all possible answers (You can list those in the description). Other users can easily add their own variation and take your suggestions from the description or - if you forgot to list a possible answer - give completely new answers.

	<h5>My filetype is still missing, what can I do?</h5>
	We are always interested in adding more data. If your company is missing up to now it is, because we did not have an example-file to optimize our parser on it.
