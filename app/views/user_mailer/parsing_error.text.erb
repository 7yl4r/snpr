Hello <%=@user.name%>,

We are sorry to inform you that there was at least one line in your genotyping-file, excluding the header, that could not be parsed correctly. This may be a minor problem or not. If you can't see your local genotypes for the SNPs or you encounter any other problems you could try to delete your genotyping file at <%=edit_user_url(@user)%>. Afterwards you can re-upload your genotyping file.

If you are sure that you set the correct filetype and everything else also should be okay, but this bug persists: Please let us know. Maybe your DTC-company changed the file-format they use.

If you need some help you can read the FAQ <%=faq_url()%> or contact us by replying to this mail.

Cheers,
your openSNP-team.
