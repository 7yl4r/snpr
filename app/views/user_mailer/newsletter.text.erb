Hi <%=@user.name%>,
Nearly 6 months have passed since we started openSNP, and much has happened! Over 300 users have provided information about over 70 different phenotypes and in total over 120 genotyping data sets have been uploaded. This is a huge success for us and we'd like to thank all of you who are participating in this project. We also want to use this mailing to give you some updates on what has changed and happened on openSNP:

1. What we are doing with the money from WikiMedia
2. openSNP how has JSON API & DAS-support
3. Our visual genome browser
4. Improvement on entering phenotypes

1. What we are doing with the money from WikiMedia 
Yesterday marked the application deadline for the free genotypings which we will fund with the 5000 â‚¬ of funding we got through the German WikiMedia foundation. Over 400 people have applied, and we are going through all the applications. The response to this shows us how many people are willing to share their data with the public. Unfortunately, we don't have enough funding to get all applicants genotyped. So we will set out to try to get more funding. If you have an idea for this, please let us know!

2. openSNP now has JSON API & DAS-support
Good news for everybody who wants to build an application which uses data from openSNP: We implemented a JSON API which you can use to get details about single SNPs and the genotypes of users at given SNPs, as well as to grab phenotypes for different users. If you want to learn more about the JSON API you should read this blog post which has some examples: http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/some-progress-on-the-api-json-endpoints/

We've also added support for the Distributed Annotation System (DAS). The data of each user who has uploaded genetic information automatically gets transformed into a DAS compatible data source. This allows to query SNPs and visualize them easily in genome browsers and other bioinformatical third party tools. More details about this can be found here: http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/videos-on-opensnp-das-support/

3. Our visual genome browser
The main reason we implemented DAS on openSNP was to give you a simple visual genome browser. On each SNP-page you will see such a browser, and if you're logged in and have uploaded your own genotyping data, you will also see your SNPs appear here. An example of this can be found here: http://opensnp.org/snps/rs6265

4. Improvement on entering phenotypes
Your starting page on openSNP has always displayed the phenotypes for which you did not enter information yet. But until now you couldn't easily add your variation for those phenotypes from the page. We added support for this, so now you can use this page if you are looking for a way to enter lots of phenotypes in rapid succession and gain some achievements!

If you are more interested in browsing the phenotypes you might like our new recommendation feature for similar phenotypes. Each phenotype-page now displays a list of the most similar phenotypes, and if you use the old way of entering your variation through the phenotype-pages instead of the dashboard you will get suggestions specifically for you. If you'd like to know more about this, this blogpost might be of interest to you: http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2012/03/26/update-on-the-free-genotypings-and-new-features-on-opensnp/

Thanks for reading this! And as usual: If you have any suggestions, find bugs or have any other feedback please contact us by either replying to this mail or by contacting us directly on openSNP (Bastian at http://opensnp.org/users/1 or Philipp at http://opensnp.org/users/23http://opensnp.org/users/23 )

Cheers,
the openSNP team (Bastian, Philipp, Fabian & Helge)
