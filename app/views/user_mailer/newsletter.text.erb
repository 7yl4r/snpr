Hi <%=@user.name%>,
we know we're a bit late, but we still want to wish you a happy new year! We have been busy over the last couple of weeks and added some new features to openSNP.

First of all, there has been a major rewrite of the parts of openSNP which go through your genotyping files to make sure that your variations are shown correctly on the website. This also includes support for a new file format: The raw data as delivered by the "Inside Your Genome", an internal project of the Sanger Institute/European Bioinformatics Institute. While this project is not open to the general public, participants of the project can now opt-in to share their data with the rest of the world as well as receive the annotation we have stored for their SNPs.

The second big change is that we've added picture phenotypes. If you ever ended up wondering how to describe your phenotypic variation in text form you can now simply upload a picture. Those picture phenotypes are an addition to the text phenotype-questions which you are used to and do not replace them. So if you don't mind sharing a description of your eye color but don't want to upload a picture of your eyes: That's still possible. As usual with openSNP: If a picture phenotype you would like to see on the platform is missing you can create it straight away so that other people can add pictures about themselves. A first example of a picture phenotype, for eye color, can be found here: https://opensnp.org/picture_phenotypes/2

Besides this we've also made contact to some of the Personal Genomics / Quantified Self campaigns which are currently fundraising on Indiegogo. With Talking20, a startup for personal proteomics, and uBiome, a startup for personal microbiomes, there are two projects which might be of special interest to you as well. We've contacted both campaigns and you can read more about them on our blog: http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/crowdfunding-dtc-microbiomics-proteomics/
If they are successful we are looking forward to add support for their data to openSNP as well.

If you have any questions regarding openSNP, ideas for new features or find any bugs: Please contact us. We're really interested in your feedback!

Cheers,
Bastian, Philipp, Fabian & Helge.
