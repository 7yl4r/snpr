Dear <%=@user.name%>,
each year Google is running its Google Summer of Code (GSoC), which is aimed at students to get started with open source work. Students participating in it will get paid by Google to work on a specific open source project for 3 months.

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) has put up a few of our project ideas, so if you're a currently enrolled student and you want to work on improving openSNP while earning money, our proposed projects are listed here: http://obf.github.io/GSoC/ideas/#opensnp

Most of the projects don't require too much specific biology knowledge but basic proficiency in Ruby (on Rails) and Web Development. And even if you're lacking the Ruby skills but know other scripting languages it might be something for you. You won't be on your own, as we will mentor successful applicants.

Some more general information on OBF's GSoC and how to apply can be found at: http://obf.github.io/GSoC/

The application deadline for this year's Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is approaching fast (March 25th). So If you're interested in participating in this program, just reply to this newsletter or join us on gitter at https://gitter.im/openSNP/snpr

Cheers,
Helge, Bastian, Philipp
