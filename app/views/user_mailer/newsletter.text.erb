Hello <%=@user.name%>,
openSNP has now been around for some days and first of all we'd like to thank you the interest and for joining our project. There were some bugs during the first days after the launch that you may or may not have noticed. But thanks to the great user-feedback we got, we could fix all we were aware of. If you find any new/not fixed bugs please let us know.
By now we also have emptied the queue of genotyping-files that wanted to get entered into the openSNP-database. 

We did our best to optimize everything on speed, but still you might have noticed some long rendering-times for pages. We already bought a new server to fix this and migrated openSNP to it. But we also used the time to implement some new features for you:

# FEATURES # 

## Upload of FamilyTreeDNA-files ## 
You can now upload the Illumina-formatted files of FamilyTreeDNA to openSNP. If you are not sure which kind of filetype you've got you can now consult our FAQ: http://opensnp.org/faq#filetypes 

## Mail-Notifications ## 
We've built a simple mail-notification-system that you can control via your user-settings. You can opt-in for a range of email-notifications:
* Get an email for each new message a user sends you
* Get an email for each new reply you get in the comments 
* Get an email every time a new phenotype is entered, so you can enter your variation on this one as well. 

And if you don't want us to send any mails like this? You can also set this. All notification-settings can be found here: <%=edit_user_url(@user)%>#notifications

## New Phenotypes ## 
Thanks to some active users there are lots of new phenotypes that can be entered. Those range from coffee consumption and nicotine dependence to colour blindness. If you want to enter some of those just visit http://opensnp.org/news#phenotypes

# FEATURE REQUESTS AND BUG-FIXING #
You found a bug that has not been fixed yet? Or have a great idea for some more features that totally need to be added to openSNP? Please let us know. You may send us a reply to this email or comment on our blog: http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/5-days-after-launch-%E2%80%93%C2%A0time-for-some-more-information/

Thanks for your attention and enjoy using the platform,
your openSNP-Team
