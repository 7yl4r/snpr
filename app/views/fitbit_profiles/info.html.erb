<legend>Connect your <%=image_tag("/images/fitbit_logo_dark_100px.png")%>  account to openSNP</legend>
<p class="lead"><em><a href="http://www.fitbit.com">FitBit</a></em> allows you to track your activities (How many steps have you taken? How many floors have you climbed?), your sleep (How long did you sleep? How often have you awoken at night?) and your body (i.e. your weight/BMI). The data collected by your <em>FitBit</em> could be a valuable extension of the phenotypes you've already entered in openSNP.</p>

<p class="lead">Once you've connected your <em>FitBit</em> account to openSNP we will automatically get your latest data from FitBit. So each time you synchronize your <em>FitBit</em>-tracker the changes will also appear on openSNP.</p>
