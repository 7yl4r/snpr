    <p>We will save data from three different categories: <strong>Body</strong>, <strong>Activities</strong> and <strong>Sleep</strong>.</p>
    <p>For the <strong>Body</strong> category we will save your Body Mass Index (BMI) and your weight (Unfortunately there's currently no option to get your height through <em>Fitbit</em> but you can calculate it through BMI and weight).</p>
    <p>For <strong>Sleep</strong> we will save how long you have slept and how often you have awoke, how long you've been awake and how long it took you to fall asleep.</p>
      <p>For the <strong>Activities</strong> we will save how many steps you have taken and how many floors you have climbed.</p><p>We will try to save the data you have uploaded to <em>Fitbit</em> up to now as well. You can decide which categories we should save. So if you feel comfortable to share your activities but neither weight nor sleep information that's no problem.</p>
