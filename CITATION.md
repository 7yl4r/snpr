# openSNP: The paper! 

Our work with *openSNP* [has been published in *PLOS ONE* in 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089204). If you are re-using code or use data from *openSNP* it would be great if you could cite the paper, so we also see where people are putting the project to good use. 

If you're using *bibtex* you can use the following code:
