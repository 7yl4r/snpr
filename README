SNPr - a repository to which users can upload their SNP-sets from 23andme and decodeme. SNPs are annotated using the PLoS and Mendeley-APIs to show users the newest results on their SNPs. etc.


You need to have the following running to ensure that everything works:

1. redis-server
2. rake environment resque:work QUEUE=*
3. and of course rails s(erver)
