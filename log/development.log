DEPRECATION WARNING: Overwriting validate in your models has been deprecated, please use Base#validate :method_name instead. (called from /home/drsnuggles/Rails/snpr/db/seeds.rb:9)
DEPRECATION WARNING: Errors#on have been deprecated, use Errors#[] instead.
Also note that the behaviour of Errors#[] has changed. Errors#[] now always returns an Array. An empty Array is returned when there are no errors on the specified attribute. (called from validate at /home/drsnuggles/Rails/snpr/app/models/user.rb:41)
